                <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
                <h2><a href="https://www.walmart.com">Walmart</a></h2>
                <p>Walmart utilizes visual hierarchy on their home page. The user is able to
                    easily identify what they are supposed to look at first, second, third,
                    and so on. The biggest eye-catcher is the "Eat, drink, & be scary" banner
                    on the top. The next item in the hierarchy is the "Free Grocery Pickup."
                    You can tell it is next, because it is smaller than the banner, but it still
                    catches your eye.</p>

                <h1>Fitt's Law</h1>
                <h2><a href="http://www.byui.edu">BYU-Idaho</a></h2>
                <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho utilizes Fitt's Law on their login page with their
                    buttons. The login button is the largest because it is the one that will be used
                    the most often. It will be used much more than change username, change password,
                    forgot username, or forgot password. This is a variation of visual hierarchy.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h2>
                <p>Apple utilizes white space and clean design on all of the pages on their website.
                    They allow their products to breathe. It gives the website a very sleek and high
                    quality. It is clean. You are able to easily tell what is the most important item
                    on the page because it is not being attacked my too many other objects surrounding
                    it. However, there is still content.</p>
