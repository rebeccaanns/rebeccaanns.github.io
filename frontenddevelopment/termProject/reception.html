                    <p>Our reception hall makes it easy to get married in the temple and be close to your venue. You and
                        your guests can stay in the hotel, so you can be close to the temple. The shuttle will be
                        avaliable for use for anyone who would like.</p>

                    <h2>Food Service</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest decisions you will make for your reception is what food to serve. We hope we
                        can take away some of the stress of this, by providing food with the cost of the venue. We offer
                        a classic, sit-down dinner, a buffet, serve yourself food stations, or a cocktail style
                        reception. You can choose up to two with variations of your choice.</p>
                    <p>You and your spouse to be will meet with our chef to decide your menu and specific items. You can
                        choose flavors and styles. We will also work around any allergies or dislikes. We hope to make
                        the food something you always remember.</p>
