                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Establised in 2003, Temple Inn & Suites provides its guests with a heavenly experience. We wanted to
                    create a space where people could get away from the world. In our hotel, you are able to be in a
                    comforting home-style room, while also getting to enter the Lord's house.</p>
                <p>We created these hotels, in the hopes that others would enjoy being close to the temple, as we do. It
                    can be so hard to find a hotel near a temple. If you do not have a car, it can be near impossible to
                    make it to the temple. We wanted to make both of these things easier for our guests, because we have
                    experienced the stress and disappointment that comes from missing out. We have provided a shuttle to
                    the temple at no extra cost. We also have members of our staff trained to help you get family name
                    cards to take to the temple. These were all things that very extremely important to us when creating
                    our hotels.</p>
                <p>We hope you decide to stay with us. We want you to be able to experience all that we have to offer.
                    If there is something you think would improve your stay, let us know! We always want to make our
                    "home" better!</p>
