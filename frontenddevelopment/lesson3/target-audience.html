                <h1>Scenarios</h1>
                <p>Sally uses her phone to look up the weather while at work. She wants to go to the beach when
                   she gets off. She needs to find the hourly weather.
                </p>
                <p>Sam and his family are looking at the weather. They see that it is too cold to go to the beach,
                   but they still want to do something as a family. They would like to see some ideas of activities
                   in the area. 
                </p>
                <p>Sally has friends coming into town to go on a vacation. They want weather specifically for
                   the area they are visiting. They want something that will quickly let them know when they can
                   go to the beach.
                </p>
                <p>Some of Sam's kids do not know how to read yet. They want to just look at the pictures to see
                   what the weather will be like this week.
                </p>
                <p>Sally just wants a quick view of what thee temperature is at that current moment.</p>
